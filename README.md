## About

Neptune is a multimodal tool designed to streamline content creation through deep analysis, emotional alignment, and human-centric tooling. It integrates discovery, style ingestion, frame-level inspection, and audio tone separation to produce layered analysis and thus enabling the creator to communicate with  greater depth. With support for YouTube links, asset sourcing, and automated issues reporting, Neptune transforms raw media into curated, emotionally resonant narratives. It is being built on FastAPI with Gemini-backed scripting and a modular Drawboard to organise various creative assets. It redefines how creators build, refine, and preserve clarity.
